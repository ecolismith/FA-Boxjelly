# Translation summary

_This summary was automatically generated by running the language helper._

Auto-sort and generate translation file contents using:

```bash
node public/app-resources/languages/_helper.js en
```

Where `en` is your language code.

Translation file format can be checked using:

```bash
npm run translation-check
```

_Note: If using Docker, add `sudo docker compose run web` before the commands.
For example, `sudo docker compose run web npm run translation-check`._
